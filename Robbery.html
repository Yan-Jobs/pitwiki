<span><strong>Robbery</strong> is a <a href="Major_Event">major event</a> in the Hypixel Pit. Like all major events, when it occurs, 3 minutes advance warning is given. Robbery lasts for 4 minutes.</span><br>
<span>When a Robbery event starts, players are given a stash of 100<a href="Gold">g</a>. If a player joins during a robbery event, they will start with no gold in their stash. Hitting a player steals gold from their stash. The more damage was dealt, and the larger the target's stash was, the more will be taken, up to 50g. Killing a player takes their entire stash. The maximum stash a player can have is 10,000g. Placement is determined by how large players' stashes are at the end of the event.<br>
<span>During Robbery, the following gameplay changes take effect:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
  <li>On death, players lose 75% of their stash.</li>
  <li>Rarely, golden nuggets spawn on the ground. Picking them up adds 50g to a player's stash.</li>
</ul>
  <span>The following rewards can be also obtained during Robbery:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" clascss="body">
    <li>2 <a href="Renown">renown</a> and 2&times; your gold stash for scoring in the top 3</li>
    <li>1 renown and 1.5&times; your gold stash for scoring in the top 10</li>
    <li>1 renown and your gold stash for scoring in the top 20</li>
    <li>500 gold if at least 100,000 statsh gold was transferred between players during the event</li>
</ul>
