<p><i>Hello, everyone!</i> It's me, <span class="md">Brooking Cooking</span>, and today, I'll be showing you all the recipe on how to cook a delicious Pit Soufflé.</p>
<p>Now, I'm sure you're all thinking, "Brooke, how can a soufflé possibly be pit?" Well, that's exactly what I'm here to show you today! I'm going to walk you through all the steps, from the ingredients to the cooking process, to help you make a mouth-watering Pit Soufflé that everyone in your family is sure to love. I was taught this recipe by my grandmother, so trust me when I say it's an old family favorite. She always used the freshest ingredients and the classic flavors that make this soufflé a real treat.</p>
<p>Back when I was a kid, my brother and I used to fight over who got to eat the leftovers. She was a great cook. Too bad she's not here to see this recipe being passed on to a new generation. She would've been so confused as to what I'm doing right now: writing words on a computer. I'd always have to help her with her emails. I remember how she used to say, "Brooke, I don't know how it works. It's like magic." I'd always sigh and say, "No, Grandma, it's not like magic. It's just technology." With a blank stare, she'd just pat my arm and say, "Whatever you say, dear." I put up with her, though. Even though she'd berate me for not following the recipe exactly, at least I knew she was just trying to look out for me. She was really strict, though.</p>
<p>I remember one time I tried to sneak out of the house after 8:30, and she caught me. "Brooke, what on earth are you up to?" she asked. Now, I was just a kid, so I lied and said I was going to the store to get milk. She just looked at me and said, "We don't live anywhere near a store, Brooke. Don't lie to me." I was rooted to the spot; too scared to move. After what felt like hours, she disappeared. Come to think of it, that was pretty weird. I don't remember her going anywhere; she just vanished. Maybe I'm forgetting something.</p>
<p>I had a lot of other really weird experiences with her, honestly. There was that time when she was making dinner and the kitchen suddenly filled up with fog. I pulled out my phone to take a photo and she slapped it out of my hand and told me to never use that "instrument of the devil" again. Another time, she was baking a cake and it started raining inside the house. I asked her what was happening, and she freaked out a lot and said that I should go to my room, lest I be a sacrifice to the Eater of Worlds. It only got weirder after that—as the years went by, she'd start randomly speaking in a strange language, and then she'd disappear or show up somewhere completely unexpected. I was with my friends in a bowling alley once, and I swear I saw her staring at me from a distance. It was really strange, since I was on a class trip to England then.</p>
<p>Things started to fall apart after I confronted her. The last straw was on her eightieth birthday, when I asked her why she was always so weird. I'll never forget the words she croaked out as her eyes turned to black and the room span: "You must be watched, my child, for you are the chosen one. The prophecies have been written. The time is now." Her face slowly crumbled into a million pieces as she turned to dust. I haven't heard from her since.</p></span></div>
