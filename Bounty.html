<p><strong>Bounties</strong> are statuses added to players randomly after they reach a 6 kill streak. On kill, a player has a chance to receive a bounty, or if they already have one, for it to be increased (referred to as "bumping"). When the player is killed, their killer claims the amount of gold detailed in the bounty.</p>
<p>The higher a player's kill streak, the higher their initial bounty will be, and the higher their bounty bumps will be. Additionally, players will receive bounty bumps more frequently the quicker they kill players. </p>
  <p>The maximum bounty a player can normally have is 5000g. This can be increased by to 10000g by the <a href = "Highlander">Highlander</a> megastreak. Every 1000g in the player's bounty extends their combat timer by 5 seconds, up to an additional 25 seconds (5000g).</p>

  <p>The amount of gold claimed from a bounty can be increased by 50% using a <a href = "Item_Shop#Bounty_Solvent">Bounty Solvent</a>. Additionally, players using the <a href = "Perks#Bounty_Hunter">Bounty Hunter</a> perk earn assist shares of bounties.</p>
  <p>With a <a href = "Genesis">Genesis</a> tier V <a href = "Factions">Faction</a> perk, bounty bumps on yourself are increased by 50%.</p>

  <p class = "section">Trivia</p>
  <p>The <a href = "Dark_Pants">Golden Handcuffs</a> dark mystic shares bounties claimed with all players on the server.</p>
  <p>The <a href = "Everyone_Gets_a_Bounty">Everyone Gets a Bounty</a> event allows players to bypass the bounty limit.</p>
