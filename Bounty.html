<p><strong>Bounties</strong> are statuses added to players randomly after they reach a <a href="Killstreaks">killstreak</a> of six or greater. Bounties consist of an amount of <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> that is displayed above and around the player with floating numbers. On kill, a player has a chance to have a bounty placed on them, or if they already have one, for it to be increased (referred to as "bounty bumping"). When a bountied player is killed, their killer claims the value of the bounty. Players lose their bounties after being killed.</p>

<p>The higher a player's killstreak, the higher their initial bounty will be, and the higher their bounty bumps will be. Additionally, players will receive bounty bumps more frequently if they kill players faster.</p>
  <p>The maximum bounty a player can normally have is <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">5,000g</span></a>. This can be increased by to <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">10,000g</span></a> with the <a href = "Highlander">Highlander</a> megastreak. Every <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">1,000g</span></a> in the player's bounty extends their combat timer by 5 seconds, up to an additional 25 seconds (<a href="Gold"><span class="m6">5,000g</span></a>).</p>

  <p>The amount of <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> claimed from a bounty can be increased by 50% using a <a href = "Item_Shop#Bounty_Solvent">Bounty Solvent</a>. Additionally, players using the <a href = "Perks#Bounty_Hunter">Bounty Hunter</a> perk earn assist shares of bounties.</p>
  <p>With the <a href = "Genesis">Genesis</a> tier V <a href = "Factions">faction</a> perk, your bounty bumps are increased by 50%.</p><hr class="smallbreak">
