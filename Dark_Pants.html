<hr>
<span><strong>Dark Pants</strong> are special types of <a href="Mystic_Pants">mystic pants</a> designed to counter <a href="Renown#Mysticism">Mysticism</a>. Fresh dark pants can be crafted for 5 <a href = "Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile</a> and 2 <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> <strong>at night</strong> if the user has at least one tier of the Prestige <span class="me">VI</span> <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> upgrade Heresy. Every extra tier of Heresy the player has reduces the vile cost of Dark Pants by 1 Chunk of Vile. Dark pants are as strong as leather pants.</span><br>
<span>Dark pants function differently from fresh pants. Upgrading dark pants to tier I requires <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">10,000g</span></a> and Heresy I, but unlike typical mystic pants, it does not require Mysticism IX. Tier I Dark Pants will always be enchanted with Somber and have 5–20 lives. </span><br>

  <span>To upgrade to tier II, the player must have Mysticism IX, Heresy III, and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">60,000g</span></a>, at which point the pants will be enchanted with a random dark enchant.</span><br>

<span>Dark Pants used to be as strong as chainmail pants. This was changed to leather in early 2020.</span><br>
<span>The time period the Nostalgia enchantment refers to is the time before the <a href = "https://hypixel.net/threads/the-pit-0-3-5-second-map-and-mystic-well.1729768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.3.5</a> update, when Protection I diamond armor could be found in <a href=Care_Package">Care Packages</a>.</span></span></div>
