<hr>
<span><strong>Fresh Pants</strong>, commonly referred to as "fresh", are unenchanted leather pants. Fresh pants have the capability of being enchanted into mystic pants, giving them enchantments.<br><span>There are several kinds of fresh pants in the game:</span>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
<li>Fresh red, orange, yellow, green, and blue pants (<span class="mc">P</span><span class="m6">a</span><span class="me">n</span><span class="ma">t</span><span class="m9">s</span>);</li>
<ul><li> Confusingly, these pants are typically the only colors that players call "fresh pants". This is beacause these colors are the most common, have the same possible enchantments, and have been in the game for the longest. These pants are usually obtained from killing players while using the <a href="Renown#Mysticism">Mysticism</a> renown upgrade, but can also be found in Care Packages. Fresh pants can be enchanted into mystic pants with the Mysticism renown upgrade, unlocked at <a href="Prestige">prestige</a> <span class="m9">I</span> for 10 <a href="Renown">renown</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>Fresh <a href="Dark_Pants">dark pants</a>, used to negate the effects of other mystic pants. Note that while other fresh pants are as strong as iron, dark pants are only as strong as leather.</li>
<li>Fresh <a href="Rage_Pants">rage pants</a>, designed to be powerful against certain enchantments;</li>
<li>Fresh <a href="Sewer_Pants">sewer pants</a>, pants with the ability to turn into powerful mystic pants.</li>
</ul>
<span>To save inventory space, ten pairs of fresh pants of any color can be merged into one inventory slot using an empty Pants Bundle (typically abbreviated as "pb" when full).<br>Empty Pants Bundles are a shop item that can be unlocked in the Renown shop at prestige <span class="m6">XII</span> for 20 Renown. Once unlocked, they can be purchased at the "Items" NPC for 50 <a href="Gold">gold</a>.</span><br>
