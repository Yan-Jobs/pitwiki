<span><strong>Auction</strong> is a <a href="Minor_Event">minor event</a> in the Hypixel Pit. When the event starts, one randomly-generated item will be put up for auction for 60 seconds. All players that were in the lobby when the auction started can bid on the item using <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a>. Spending <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> on the auction bypasses the <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> trade limit. Bidding on the auction when there are less than 20 seconds left extends the timer by 10 seconds. The player who has bid the most at the end of the event receives the item. If the player loses the auction and is in the lobby when it ends, their <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> will be refunded.<br><span>Players are unable to auction items themselves; the only way for players to sell items is through trading.</span><br><br>

<span>There are many types of items that may appear in an Auction event:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>Tier III Mystic Swords, randomly enchanted as if they were used in the Mystic Well</li>
    <li>Tier III Mystic Pants, randomly enchanted as if they were used in the Mystic Well</li>
    <li>Tier I Mystic Pants with 5 or 10 lives, enchanted with Pit MBA I, Fractional Reserve I, or <span class="md">RARE!</span> Paparazzi I</li>
    <li>1 <a href="Philosophers_Cactus">Philosopher's Cactus</a></li>
    <li>3&ndash;6 <a href="Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile</a></li>
    <li>2&times; <a href="Mystic_Pants">Fresh Pants</a> of any standard color</li>
    <li>2&ndash;8 <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a></li>
    <li>A full set of diamond armor</li>
    <li>1-5&times; Funky Feathers, rarely</li>
    <li>Mystic Repair Kits, very rarely</li>
</ul><br>

<table class="item body">
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><img src="./images/auction_crazy_bid.png" width="100%"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="small center">A player bidding seven million <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> on a Mystic Sword.</td>

<span>Before <a href="Prestige">prestiging</a>, higher-prestige players occasionally bid absurdly large amounts of <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> on auctions as they have nowhere else to spend their <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a>.</span><br>
<span>The Mystic Pants enchants Pit MBA, Fractional Reserve, and Paparazzi can only be obtained through Auctions.</span><br>

<span>Admins, extremely rarely, auction off vanilla Minecraft items for sale. Named "admin items" by the community, these typically are blocks or flowers and are very valuable.</span><br>
<span>The Auction event was added in <a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/the-pit-update-0-4-events-extravaganza.2018236/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pit 0.4 - Events Extravaganza</a>. Two players were credited for its creation; one suggested the name "Shop Frenzy" for the event.</span></div>
