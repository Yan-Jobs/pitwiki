<hr>
<span><strong>Beast</strong> is a major event in the Hypixel Pit. Like all major events, when it occurs, 3 minutes advance warning is given. Beast lasts for 5 minutes.</span><br>
<span>When a Beast event starts, three random players are chosen to be Beasts. If a player kills the beast, they become a beast. Beasts are given a diamond chestplate with protection II, diamond leggings with Fire Protection V (if they are not wearing mystic pants), diamond boots with Projectile Protection V, and a diamond sword. Placement is determined by how many beasts a player killed and how many players they killed as the beast.<br>
<span>During Beast, the following gameplay changes take effect:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>Beasts have twice the health of a normal player but cannot gain health by any method except <a href = "Renown#Tenacity">Tenacity</a>. </li>
    <li>Double gold and XP on kills and assists while you are a Beast.</li>
    <li>Beasts gain 250g for every 5 total seconds that they have been the Beast</li>
    <li>The Devil Chicks, Explosive, TNT and all healing mystics are disabled.</li>
    <li>You do not lose lives on mystic items if you die as a Beast.</li>
</ul>
  <span>The following rewards can be also obtained during Beast:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>1 <a href="Renown">renown</a> if the player scored within the top 20, or 2 renown if the player scored within the top 3</li>   
  <li>500 <a href="Gold">gold</a> if the player scored within the top 20, or 2000 gold if the player scored within the top 3</li>
  <li>100 gold if the player did not score within the top 20</li>
  <li>500 gold if no beast was the beast for longer than a total of 90 seconds</li>
  <li>Diamond chestplate and boots if the player was a Beast at the end of the event

</ul>

<span>Prior to a patch in late 2021, the Golden Heart mystic could be used to survive for an extended period of time as Beast.</span><br>
