<hr>
<p><strong>Totally Legit Gems</strong>, commonly referred to as just "gems", are items in The Pit that can be used on <a href = "Mystic_Well">mystic items</a>.</p>
  <p>When held and right-clicked, a GUI with every eligible mystic in the player's inventory will be opened. The player can then select a mystic and a non-<span class = md>RARE!</span> enchant on the mystic that is at a tier lower than III to increase the enchant's tier by one token.</p>
  <p>Mystics must meet the following conditions to be considered eligible:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>The mystic must be at tier III.

    <li>The mystic may not already have more than eight total tokens.</li>

    <li>The mystic must have at least one non-<span class = md>RARE!</span> enchant with less than three tokens.</li>

</ul>
  
  <p>The gem will be consumed on use.</p>

  <p>Using a gem on a mystic item causes a green icon to appear next to the lives count. If an item has had a gem applied, it will cost twice as many <a href = "Chunk_of_Vile">Chunk of Vile</a> to repair using the <a href = "Magnum_Opus">Magnum Opus</a> megastreak.</p><hr class="smallbreak">
<p class="section">Trivia</p>
<p>Shortly after release, a bug was discovered allowing players to apply multiple gems to the same item. This allowed for the creation of some mystics that are not normally possible to obtain in the Mystic Well. The bug was patched at a later date.</p></span></div>
