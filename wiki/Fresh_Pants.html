<hr>
<span><strong>Fresh Pants</strong>, commonly referred to as "fresh", are unenchanted leather pants. Fresh pants have the capability of being enchanted into mystic pants, giving them enchantments.<br><span>There are several kinds of fresh pants in the game:</span>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
<li>Fresh red, orange, yellow, green, and blue pants (<span class="mc">P</span><span class="m6">a</span><span class="me">n</span><span class="ma">t</span><span class="m9">s</span>);</li>
<ul><li> Confusingly, these pants are typically the only colors that players call "fresh pants". This is due to the reason that these colors are the most common, standard, and have been in the game for the longest. These pants are usually obtained from killing players with the Mysticism Renown upgrade, but can also be found in Care Packages. Fresh pants can be enchanted into mystic pants with the Mysticism Renown upgrade, unlocked at <a href="Prestige">prestige</a> <span class="m9">I</span> for 10 Renown.</li>
</ul>
<li>Fresh aqua pants, used for fishing;</li>
<li>Fresh dark pants, used to negate the effects of mystic pants;</li>
<li>Fresh rage pants, designed to be powerful against certain enchantments;</li>
<li>Fresh sewer pants, pants with the ability to turn into powerful mystic pants.</li>
</ul>
<span>To save inventory space, ten pairs of fresh pants of any color can be merged into one Pants Bundle (abbreviated as "pb").<br>Empty pants bundles are a shop item that can be unlocked in the Renown shop at prestige <span class="m6">XII</span> for 20 Renown. Once unlocked, they can be purchased at the "Items" NPC for 50 gold.</span><br>
