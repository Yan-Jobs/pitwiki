<span><strong>Chunks of Vile</strong>, commonly referred to as "vile", are items in The Pit that are used to create special types of <a href="Fresh_Pants">fresh pants</a>. They can be earned in contracts with the Heresy Renown upgrade, completing Night Quests, and through <a href="Auction">auctions</a>.<br><br><span>With the Heresy Renown upgrade unlocked at <a href="Prestige">prestige</a> <span class="me">VI</span>, fresh dark pants can be crafted with 5 Chunks of Vile. This cost decreases by 1 for every level of Heresy the player has unlocked (minimum of 3). Fresh rage pants require 17 Chunks of Vile to craft and the Pure Rage Renown upgrade, unlocked at prestige <span class="me">IX</span>.</span><br><br><span>Due to the popularity of vile, it is commonly used as currency in trading because of the gold trading limits.</span><br><span>Chunks of Vile can also be used to repair mystic items. The megastreak Grand Finale will increase a player's chosen mystic item's lives by 4. This cost is 4 Chunks of Vile for most items&mdash; the exception is for gemmed items, which cost 8 vile to repair.</span><br><br>
