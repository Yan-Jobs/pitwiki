<span><strong>Mystic Bows</strong> are mystic items obtained extremely rarely from killing players while the killer has the <a href = "Renown#Mysticism">Mysticism</a> renown upgrade.</span><br><br>
<span>While unenchanted, Mystic Bows are functionally identical to normal bows. However, they can be upgraded in the <a href = "Mystic_Well">Mystic Well</a>. Upgrading to tier I costs 1000g, upgrading to tier II costs 4000g, and upgrading to tier III costs 8000g and requires a sacrifice of a randomly chosen color of <a href = "Mystic_Pants">Mystic Pants</a> and Mysticism IX.</span><br><br>
<span>Enchanting Mystic Bows gives them a random number of lives that increases on every tier and removes their Kept on Death status. Lives decrease by 1 on death, or by 3 if you log out while in combat. Depleting all lives on a mystic item "breaks" the mystic item, destroying it forever.</span><br><br>
<span>When enchanted, Mystic Bows gain random enchantments with varying effects. Upon upgrading to tier I, they gain 1-2 'tokens' (total tiers) of a low-grade enchantment. When upgrading to tier II, they gain 1-2 more tokens of any enchantment, and at tier III, they gain 1-4 more tokens, up to 8 total.</span>
<span>The list of enchantments that can be obtained at tier I is as follows:</span><br>
<table class="body">

    <tr style="font-weight: bold; position: sticky; top: 0" class="invisible_fill">

        <td>Name</td><td>Description</td>

    </tr>
    <tr id="Bottomless_Quiver" name="Bottomless_Quiver">
      <td>Bottomless Quiver</td><td rowspan="3">Receive 1 arrow on arrow hit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Receive 3 arrows on arrow hit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Receive 8 arrows on arrow hit.</td>
    </tr>
  
    
  </table><br>
  <span>The list of enchantments that additionally can be obtained at tier II or higher is as follows:</span><br>
  <table class="body">

    <tr style="font-weight: bold; position: sticky; top: 0" class="invisible_fill">

        <td>Name</td><td>Description</td>

    </tr>
    <tr id="Arrow_Armory" name="Arrow_Armory">
      <td>Arrow Armory</td><td rowspan="3">Consume 3 arrows on shot but deal +12% arrow damage.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Consume 5 arrows on shot but deal +25% arrow damage.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Consume 8 arrows on shot but deal +60% arrow damage.</td>
