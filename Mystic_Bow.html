<span><strong>Mystic Bows</strong> are mystic items obtained extremely rarely from killing players while the killer has the <a href = "Renown#Mysticism">Mysticism</a> renown upgrade.</span><br><br>
<span>While unenchanted, Mystic Bows are functionally identical to normal bows. However, they can be upgraded in the <a href = "Mystic_Well">Mystic Well</a>. Upgrading to tier I costs 1000g, upgrading to tier II costs 4000g, and upgrading to tier III costs 8000g, requires Mysticism IX, and requires a sacrifice of a randomly chosen color of <a href = "Mystic_Pants">Mystic Pants</a>.</span><br><br>
<span>Enchanting Mystic Bows gives them a random number of lives that increases on every tier and removes their Kept on Death status. Lives decrease by 1 on death, or by 3 if you log out while in combat. Depleting all lives on a mystic item "breaks" the mystic item, destroying it forever.</span><br><br>
<span>When enchanted, Mystic Bows gain random enchantments with varying effects. Upon upgrading to tier I, they gain 1-2 'tokens' (total tiers) of a low-grade enchantment. When upgrading to tier II, they gain 1-2 more tokens of any enchantment, and at tier III, they gain 1-4 more tokens, up to 8 total.</span>
<span>The list of enchantments that can be obtained at tier I is as follows:</span><br>
