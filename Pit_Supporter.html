<hr>
<p><strong>Pit Supporter</strong> is a way to support the development of The Pit with real-life money. Costing 1,000 Hypixel Gold ($10 USD), it contains minor features to help increase the quality of life of those who purchase it.</p>

<p>The following features are included in Pit Supporter:</p>
<p><strong>Supporter Star</strong>: In chat and in the tab list of in-game lobbies, players have a yellow star (<span class="me">âœ¬</span>) next to their name. The star can be toggled on and off in the Pit Supporter menu.</p>
<p><strong>Event Viewing</strong>: Players can type <span class="me">/events</span> to see the next major and minor events. Each event has a countdown to when it occurs. In the menu, fifty-four major events can be seen at once. For events occuring in less than one day, timestamps are accurate to the nearest minute; events that occur later are accurate to the nearest hour.</p>
<p><strong>Pants Dyeing</strong>: Non-special mystic <span class="mc">p</span><span class="m6">a</span><span class="me">n</span><span class="ma">t</span><span class="m9">s</span> can be dyed in eighteen different colors. Dyeing pants costs 200 <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> and is affected by <a href="Renown#Scam_Artist">Scam Artist</a>.</p>

    <tr>
        <td class="small center">A player showing off a Funky Feather.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Showoff</strong>: Players can type <span class="me">/show</span> to show off an item in chat. The item will be shown to all players in the lobby. To prevent spam in Pit lobbies, showing off items has a cooldown of two minutes. This cooldown can be bypassed by paying 10,000 <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fancier Hat</strong>: If a player has the <a href="Renown#Fancy_Hat">Fancy Hat</a> <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> upgrade and Pit Supporter, they can give their fancy hat the glow used for enchanted items. The glow has no effect on the hat's defense.</p>

<p>Pit Supporter can be purchased at <a href="Prestige">prestige</a> <span class="m9">I</span> or higher by clicking the clock in the bottom-right corner of the Prestige NPC. Hypixel Gold can be purchased on the Hypixel Store at <a href="https://store.hypixel.net/category/gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://store.hypixel.net/category/gold</a>.</p><br>
<p class="section">Trivia</p>
<span>Pit Supporter was added in version 1.0.0 when the game was removed from the Prototype Lobby. Minikloon stated that the perk was "for the super-fans".<span><br>
<span>As of June 10th, 2022, the Pit Supporter star cannot be seen in the tab list on players without a bounty.</span></span></div>
