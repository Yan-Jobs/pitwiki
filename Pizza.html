<p><strong>Pizza</strong> is a <a href="Major_Event">major event</a> in the Hypixel Pit. Like all major events, when it occurs, 3 minutes advance warning is given. Pizza lasts for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>When a Pizza event starts, a pizza stand opens at a random predetermined location on the map. By clicking the stand, players can claim up to six pizzas which must be given to villagers that spawn around the map to earn cash. Players can give pizzas to villagers by right-clicking them with a pizza in their hand. After receiving cash from a villager, it must be deposited at the pizza stand. When a player is killed, all of their pizzas are dropped and their non-deposited cash is given to the player who killed them.</p>

<p>Placement in the event is determined by how much cash the player deposited by the end of the event.</p>
<p>During Pizza, the following gameplay changes take effect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The launcher to the quadrant the pizza stand is in will redirect players to the pizza stand.</li>
  <li>Gain permanent Speed II.</li>
  <li>Villagers spawn around the map, offering $5, $10, $15, $20, or $25 for a pizza. Hold a pizza and right-click a villager to sell it to them for the offered price.</li>
  <li>On kill, take all the undeposited cash and pizza your victim had.</li>
  <li>The <span class="me">/spawn</span> command is disabled.</li>
</ul>
  <span>The following rewards can be also obtained during Pizza:</span><br>
<ul>
    <li>2 <a href="Renown">renown</a> and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">2,000 gold</span></a> for scoring in the top 3</li>
    <li>1 <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">750 gold</span></a> for scoring in the top 20</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional rewards that players can earn during Pizza:</p>
