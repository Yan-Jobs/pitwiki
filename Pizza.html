<p><strong>Pizza</strong> is a <a href="Major_Event">major event</a> in the Hypixel Pit. Like all major events, when it occurs, 3 minutes advance warning is given. Pizza lasts for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>When a Pizza event starts, a pizza stand opens at a random predetermined location on the map. Players can claim up to six pizzas from the pizza stand, which must be sold to villagers that spawn around the map to earn cash. Cash can be deposited at the pizza stand.</p>

<p>Placement in the event is determined by how much cash the player deposited by the end of the event.</p>
<p>During Pizza, the following gameplay changes take effect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The launcher to the quadrant the pizza stand is in will redirect players to the pizza stand.</li>
  <li>Gain permanent Speed II.</li>
  <li>Villagers spawn around the map, offering $5, $10, $15, $20, or $25 for a pizza. Hold a pizza and right-click a villager to sell it to them for the offered price.</li>
  <li>On kill, take all the undeposited cash and pizza your victim had.</li>
  <li>The <span class="me">/spawn</span> <a href = "Commands">command</a> is disabled.</li>
</ul>
  <span>The following rewards can be also obtained during Pizza:</span><br>
<ul>
    <li>2 <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">2,000 gold</span></a> for scoring in the top 3</li>
    <li>1 <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">750 gold</span></a> for scoring in the top 20</li>
    <li>After the player's 20th pizza delivered, receive an "Employee of the Month" bonus of <a href = "XP"><span class = mb>+4 XP</span></a> per pizza delivered, increasing by <a href = "XP"><span class = mb>+4 XP</span></a> every 2 pizzas delivered (e.g., your 22nd and 23rd pizza delivered grant <a href = "XP"><span class = mb>+8 XP</span></a> each, 24th and 25th grant <a href = "XP"><span class = mb>+12 XP</span></a> each, etc). </li>
</ul>
