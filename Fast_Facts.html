<p>In case you're in a rush, this article is for you! A team of a variety<span class="note">(one)</span> of experts<span class="note">(disputable)</span> have a treasure trove of important information about pits you should know:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's at least <span class="m6">100</span> pits in the world, a majority of which come from countries like Iceland, Vanuatu, Africa, and others like it.</li>
<li>The <span class="mc">largest</span> pit in the world is the one in my forever-broken heart.</li>
<li>Some cities, such as <span class="mb">Pittsburgh</span> (USA), are located entirely in giant crater-sized pits. The city's interesting design currently extends down up to <span class="ma">2.5 km</span> (5.65 mi) below surface level, which makes it invisible from space and on Google Maps.</li>
<li>The comet that killed the dinosaurs created a smoldering pit that continues to be on fire to this day. It alone generates <span class="me">72%</span> of the tourism revenue of Mexico.</li>
<li>Many pits are filled with something other than sediment. These filler materials can be anything from metals to liquids to dark, endless, space-consuming voids. One of the most famous pits is the Atlantic Ocean, which is filled mostly with salinated water and some hostile lifeforms.</li>
<li>The number of naturally-dug pits is drastically decreasing due to <span class="td">rapid urbanization</span>. Scientists are currently researching solutions to this drastic problem—dubbed "The Great Flattening"—such as placing potholes on highways and sinkholes in population-dense areas so that "pits and humans can co-exist in harmony".</li>
<li>To grow a pit in dirt, sand, or another man-made product, dig a hole and water it hourly. After several million years, the ground will erode.</li>
<li><a href="The_Hypixel_Pit">The Hypixel Pit</a> (2018) is the latest pit to be created. According to its creators, no pits of any kind will ever be created in the future.</li>
