<span><strong>Mystic Swords</strong> are mystic items obtained extremely rarely from killing players while the killer has the <a href = "Renown#Mysticism">Mysticism</a> <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> upgrade.</span><br><br>
<span>While unenchanted, Mystic swords act as Sharpness 2 golden swords. However, they can be upgraded in the <a href = "Mystic_Well">Mystic Well</a>. Upgrading to tier I costs <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">1,000g</span></a>, upgrading to tier II costs <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">4,000g</span></a>, and upgrading to tier III costs <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">8,000g</span></a>, requires Mysticism IX, and requires a sacrifice of a randomly chosen color of <a href = "Mystic_Pants">Mystic Pants</a>.</span><br><br>
<span>Enchanting Mystic Swords gives them a random number of lives that increases on every tier and removes their Kept on Death status. Lives decrease by 1 on death, or by 3 if their user logs out while in combat. Depleting all lives on a mystic item "breaks" it, destroying it forever.</span><br><br>
<span>When enchanted, Mystic Swords gain random enchantments with varying effects. Upon upgrading to tier I, they gain 1&ndash;2 "<a href="Mystic_Well#Tokens">tokens</a>" &ndash; total tiers &ndash; of a low-grade enchantment. When upgrading to tier II, they gain 1&ndash;2 more tokens  of any enchantment (at most one of which can be <span class = md>RARE!</span>), and at tier III, they gain 1&ndash;4 more tokens (at most three of which can be <span class = md>RARE!</span>) &ndash; up to 8 total.</span><br><br>
<span>The list of enchantments that can be obtained at tier I is as follows:</span><br><br>
