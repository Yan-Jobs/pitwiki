<hr>

<span><strong>Aqua Pants</strong> are special types of <a href = "Fresh_Pants">fresh pants</a>. They can be caught rarely while fishing if the user has the Fishing Club <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> upgrade at tier V, requiring prestige <span class="me">VII</span>. Most of their possible enchantments assist the player while fishing.</span><br>

<span>Fresh aqua pants function differently from other types of fresh pants. They can only be upgraded to tier I, at which point they will have 5 lives, the Club Rod enchantment, and a random Aqua enchant. The Club Rod enchant grants the user a fishing rod while worn.<br>Aqua pants do not require Mysticism to be enchanted.</span><br><br>

<span>The list of other Aqua enchants is as follows:</span><br>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">

    <li>Rogue: Deal +25% damage and take 10% less damage from players who are wearing aqua pants.</li>

    <li>Tough Crew: Receive -15% damage if there are at least 3 players wearing aqua pants near you.</li>

    <li>Unite: You cannot make contact with players wearing aqua pants.</li>

    <li>Rodback: Fishing rod hooks deal increased knockback.</li>

    <li>Luck of the Pond: Catch items 10% faster.</li>

    <li>Grandmaster: Fishing rod hooks deal 1 true damage.</li>

    <li>Portable Pond: Spawn with a water bucket. Can be used 4 times before becoming empty. You cannot pick up water using the empty bucket. </li>

    <li>Trophy: When catching gold ingots, catch two more.</li>

    <li><span class = "md">RARE!</span> Stereo: Play a random Hypixel note block song to all players nearby while worn.</li>




</ul>

<span>The chance to catch aqua pants is unknown but is much lower than other fishing drops.</span><br><br>


<p class="section">Trivia</p><br>

<span>Before a patch in late April 2020, Combo enchants could be used with Unite to activate them without a cooldown. This interaction led to exploits with the Combo: XP enchant, allowing players to gain <a href="XP"><span class="mb">XP</span></a> extremely quickly.</span><br>
